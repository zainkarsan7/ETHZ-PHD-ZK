Everybody I meet professionnally. Notes about all meetings.
* BD+CDW Progress Meeting
23.10.03:
Obviously scope is too broad, but apt title. HTD(a)A and the robotic
disassembly niche. Now need to systematically Lit Review perception,
planning, and robotic platforms.

Estimate the cost how appropriate Robotically Assisted Disassembly
(RAD) is for different materials, assemblies, building layers re
(Layers of Change Diagram from S. Brand 1994)

Talk to Marco Hutter, RSL, to Thomas Bock, talk to someone at Zen
Robotics, Eberhard AG, tour deconstruction sites from Catherine's
class, identify metrics for how exactly to measure a deconstruction
site in terms of % useable material, process time, environmental
impact etc.

NCCR robotics and d-fab next semester somehow. Devise some strategic
robotic disassembly experiments.
